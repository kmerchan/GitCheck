Welcome to GitCheck!

To run the program, please clone the repository using `git clone`
on your local terminal.

You can install all dependent installations and start the program
by running `~/GitCheck/install.sh`.

Now, you can move into the directory with files that you would like to
add, commit, push, and check. Inside the directory, run the program
with `~/GitCheck/gitcheck.py <files>` where <files> are the files you
are ready to check.

The first time running the program, you will be prompted to input your
Holberton credentials so the program can get and use an authorization
token. However, this will only be necessary the first time you run the
program.

If there are changes to your password or other credentials, please
remove the settings file with `rm GitClone_settings.py` in the GitCheck
respository and you will be re-prompted to input your credentials the
next time you run the program.
